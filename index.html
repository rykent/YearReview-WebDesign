		<h2>Swim Team</h2>
		<p>Another highlight was the swim team actually had meets this year. This was a huge improvement because it kinda sucked having practice without any meets last year.</p>

		<h2>Coronavirus</h2>
		<p>This isn't really a highlight like the rest of the events but it still was a big part of the school year. It has caused us to have distance learning for a few months and changed the way the world works right now.</p>
